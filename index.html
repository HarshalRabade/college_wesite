  <h1>Course We Offer</h1>
  <p>There are various kinds of courses available: from online courses to
     summer courses and intensive courses. Courses serve a multitude of purposes
      for different students: they are sometimes used to bridge the gap between 
      different phases of academic study, or to provide additional professional 
      training and qualifications. There are courses in a wide
     variety of subjects, from cosmetology to engineering, food and beverage
      studies to law and regulations, biology to fashion</p>

          <h3>intermediate</h3>
          <p>In the current scenario, gaining quality education has become the need of the hour. Moreover, 
            it is not what is taught, but how it is taught that matters the most. Furthermore, the level of
             teaching techniques adapted at the 10+2 level is the most crucial aspect as it is that phase of
              schooling that serves as the base for the students to choose their careers. Therefore,
             all those who aspire to invest in the education sector should opt for investing in starting a 10+2 school.</p>
